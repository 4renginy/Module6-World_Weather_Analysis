# Module6-World_Weather_Analysis1
## Purpose
This project is about improving PlanMyTrip app.
We already have a great app but there are a few suggestions we think it is worth trying; here are the imporvment we think worth trying.

1- We have created a weather database with following info (City, Country,Lat, Lng, MaxTemp, Humidity, Cloudiness, WindSpeed, Current Description) this will help us to add the info on the pop ups.<br>

<br>

2-We added input lines for the users to enter the temperatures to find best weather locations for their like and find nearby hotels in those locations. The app will show the heatmap layer , with hotel locations info popups.<br>

<br>

3-We added directions layer as last part of the project to help users to go from point 1 to point 2. The layer will show the route to take and all the stops the user likes to do.
